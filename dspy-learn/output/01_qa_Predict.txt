[[ ## answer ## ]]
To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed daily:**
   - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She bakes muffins with 4 eggs.
   - Total eggs consumed = 3 (breakfast) + 4 (muffins) = 7 eggs.

2. **Calculate the number of eggs sold daily:**
   - Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
   - Eggs sold = Total eggs laid - Eggs consumed = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

3. **Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs:**
   - Janet sells each egg for $2.
   - Daily revenue = Number of eggs sold * Price per egg = 9 * $2 = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.
