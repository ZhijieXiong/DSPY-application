**Response:**
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins every day.
4. Therefore, the total number of eggs she uses for herself is 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs.
5. The number of eggs she sells at the farmers' market is the total number of eggs laid minus the eggs she uses for herself: 16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs.
6. She sells each egg for $2.
7. Therefore, the total amount she makes at the farmers' market is 9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18.

[[ ## answer ## ]]
$18

[[ ## completed ## ]]
