**User message:**
[[ ## question ## ]]
Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

[[ ## final_generated_code ## ]]
# Total eggs laid per day
total_eggs = 16

# Eggs used for breakfast and baking
eggs_eaten = 3
eggs_baked = 4

# Remaining eggs for sale
remaining_eggs = total_eggs - eggs_eaten - eggs_baked

# Selling price per egg
price_per_egg = 2

# Total revenue from selling eggs
total_revenue = remaining_eggs * price_per_egg

# Output the total revenue
total_revenue

[[ ## code_output ## ]]
18

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.


**Response:**
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, leaving her with 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs to sell. She sells each egg for $2, so her total revenue from selling the eggs is 9 * 2 = $18.

[[ ## answer ## ]]
$18

[[ ## completed ## ]]
